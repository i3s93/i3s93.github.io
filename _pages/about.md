I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/) at the University of Delaware. I currently work with Jing-Mei Qiu on low-rank tensor decompositions and their application to high-dimensional kinetic models of plasma.

Before joining the University of Delaware, I was a Peter O'Donnell Jr. Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked on algorithms for radiation transport. I worked with Robert Moser and George Biros in the Center for Predictive Engineering and Computational Science at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences.

I completed my PhD in Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering at Michigan State University in 2022 under the supervision of Andrew Christlieb. My work developed new methods to integrate field equations in plasmas and integrated these techniques with particle methods to simulate plasmas.

My general research interests are computational mathematics and scientific computing. My work combines tools from approximation theory and numerical analysis to develop algorithms that address the challenges of kinetic models, such as high dimensionality, multi-scale effects, and the preservation of critical mathematical structures at the discrete level. These problems require enormous computational demands, which my work addresses in a complementary manner through a combination of mathematics with tools to access the latest advances in computing hardware.
